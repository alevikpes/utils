# If this file is copied from anywhere, one thing must be set manually:
# The "^M" symbol in the end of some strings, is not literly "^" and "M" symbols
# - it is a special symbol, which is created by "Ctrl+v" and then "Enter".
# When the config code is copied, it is necessary to recreate it, otherwise it
# is copied literly and will not work.
# This key combination only works in vim-like editors. In other editors it
# may be different - ask Google for help.

# In case of avoiding typing sudo password there are some solutions:
#   - run the whole script as `sudo screen`;
#   - use NOPASSWD directive of `sudoers` for a specific command, script or a
#       directory, see: https://askubuntu.com/a/159009;
